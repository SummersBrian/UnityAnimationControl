# UnityAnimationControl
Project for my Game Programming course in Spring 2015 at UMD. Used standard assets from the Unity
Assets Store to animate a character with standing, walking, and sprinting motions. As well as a
user controlled character, enemy robots are also included with a simple randomized direction
control scheme alternating walking directions. The project was done using Unity 5.0 and scripts
were written in C#.
